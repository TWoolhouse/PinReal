	<h1>Proximity</h1>
	<p>When nearby to a landmark, you will be prompted to take a picture with the landmark. Entering the <i>proximity activity</i> will show you:
	<ul>
		<li>Which landmark you are near.</li>
		<li>The distance from it.</li>
		<li>A button to open the Camera</li>
	</ul>
	If you choose to take a picture, your default camera app will be open and allow you to take a picture.
	Once this has completed, a new post on your account will be immediately created and a notification will be sent out to your followers.
